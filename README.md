# C-Sharp-Complex-Number

Language: c#

main points: structures, overloading operators, and unit testing 

Description: 
this project uses a structure for the complex numbers which allows us to view them in terms of thier real part and Imaginary part.
I also overloaded the operators to allow the use of normal mathmatical operators such as *, /, +, -, and ^. along with these boolean operators where 
also overlaoded to allow the comparing of lexicographic comparison. This means we compare them similairly you would last names, if the last names are the same then 
we compare the first name. In example 2+78i would be less then 3+5i using this logic one could also compare the modulus of these numbers(the distance form origin).
after words Unit testing was implamented to test these cases.
